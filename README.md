#WordPress reset app

This is a PHP function that can be added to current Wordpress theme, to the file functions.php which is located in your theme directory. 

It adds new admin user and therefore allows to reset all the settings. 

It may damage Wordpress settings. 

In my case current theme crashed. 

I have copied files from other one and than removed it and installed again but the effect is not guaranteed.

For emergency use only!
